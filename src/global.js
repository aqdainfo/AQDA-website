This will be the first archive to capture and preserve the phenomenon of LGBTIQ+ displacement. Beyond being simply another archive about particular phenomena, this archive is a political act of survival. The Assembling Queer Displacement Archive (AQDA) is being established to counter the hegemonies that permeate the displacement narratives, and to give visibility to the experiences of LGBTIQ+ forced displacement.'

    'heading': 'About Assembling Queer Displacement Archive',
    'text': '<p>Assembling Queer Displacement Archive (AQDA) is an experimentally born digital archive of oral histories about LGBTIQ+ forced displacement. This archive was developed as a doctoral research by creative work. Renee Dixson undertook their research at the Centre for Digital Humanities Research at the Australian National University. The ethical aspects of this research have been approved by the ANU Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol 2019/125).</p><p>Despite intersectionality being widely mentioned, including as policy, theory and method, some academic spaces and practices remain very one-dimensional. This is particularly true for archival practice and migration studies, each of which operates in normative ways resulting in the erasure of some ‘intersectional’ voices and dis-locations.</p><p>AQDA aims to preserve and creatively publicly present oral histories of LGBTIQ+ people who have been forcibly displaced and sought safety in Western countries due to homo-, bi-, trans- and intersexphobia, and persecution. This open digital archive addresses the phenomenon of LGBTIQ+ forced migration and has the potential to empower and give voice to those who are often socially marginalised.</p><p>Renee Dixson embraced their lived experience and found frameworks to create an archive that can become a space of resistance to the intentional forgetting, misrepresentation, and omission of LGBTIQ+ experiences. At the heart of the AQDA is the refusal to be erased.</p><p>By applying oral history methods, this unique collection foregrounds lived experiences, often invisible in formal historical records. Generated through oral history interviews, the data set is rich and unique and containing multimodal data (video, audio and text).</p><p>For safety and privacy of narrators, they may use a pseudonym and apply some additional protections such as distortion of voice or video to protect their identities. They have control over their story. They can review the interview and delete some information. They are provided with a list of support services that can be accessed in their area.</p><h3>About researcher</h3><p>Renee Dixson has started their human rights work in Ukraine, supporting and advocating for the inclusion of LGBTIQ+ communities. They led this work at the international and national levels. As a result of such visible work, they were forced to leave Ukraine. They continued LGBTIQ+ human rights work in Australia, focusing on LGBTIQ+ displacement. They now have found a new home, family and name in Australia.</p><p>Renee continues their work as an emerging academic and activist by trying to build bridges and make a systematic change to support LGBTIQ+ displaced people, including through leading the non-for-profit Forcibly Displaced People Network, the first Australian LGBTIQ+ refugee-led organisation.</p>'
